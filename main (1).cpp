// Project 6: Connect 4 Game with Backtracking

// Environment: Replit and Zybooks 
// In this project, we added to the functional Connect 4 game we created in Project 5. 
// Specifically, I added a function that outputs all the moves created by the players upon the user input of a 'P' or 'p'.  
// I also added a function that undoes the most recent move made by the user upon the user input of a 'U' or 'u'.
//To create and correctly execute these functions, I utilized a class and implemented a linked list to store the moves of each player.  
// Pass by reference allowed me to manipulate the boards and pointers associated with each node. 

// Header Files
